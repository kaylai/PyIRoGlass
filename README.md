# BASELINES

PyBL is a Bayesian MCMC-founded Python algorithm for determining volatile concentrations from rhyolitic-basaltic FTIR spectra. PyBL is written in the open-source language Python3 with the $MC^3$ package, created by Patricio Cubillos et al., allowing for the proper sampling of parameter space and the determination of volatile concentrations with uncertainties.
